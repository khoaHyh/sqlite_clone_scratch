### Part 1 - Introduction and Setting up REPL

Used ChatGPT/Claude to understand what happens to the query input when it goes to the front-end. I summarized the LLMs' output
to help myself grasp the concepts learned.

**REPL**: Read-Eval-Print-Loop

Front-end here refers to the user interface or application layer that enables users or other software to
interact with the SQLite database.

- The output of the frontend is SQLite VM bytecode that the back-end will take in as instructions.

Front-end consists of:

- **tokenizer** - responsible for breaking down input SQL query into sequence of tokens. The tokenizer scans the input character by character and identifies
  keywords, identifiers, literals, and other syntactic elements. It outputs a stream of tokens that the parser will use.
- **parser** - takes a stream of tokens and constructs a syntactic tree or parse tree. The parser enforces grammer rules of the SQL language. If the
  query is syntactically correct, the parser generates a parse tree that represents the query's structure
- **code generator** - takes the parse tree and produces a set of instructions for the DB engine to
  follow in order to fulfill the query. The code generator transforms the parse tree into an intermediate presentation
  or machine code that can be executed by the DB engine. This involves optimizing the execution plan, considering factors
  such as indexes, joins, etc.

Back-end consists of:

- **virtual machine** - takes bytecode generated by the front-end as instructions. It can then perform operations on one or more tables or indexes,
  each of which is stored in a data structure called a B-tree. The VM is essentially a big switch statement on the type of bytecode instruction.
- **B-tree** - known as a Balance Tree, is a data structure used to organize and store data. Each B-tree consists of many nodes. Each node is one
  page in length. The B-tree can retrieve a page from disk or save it back to disk by issuing commands to the pager.
- **pager** - receives commands to read or write pages of data. It is responsible for reading/writing at appropriate offsets in the database file.
  It also keeps a cache of recently-accessed pages in memory, and determines when those pages need to be written back to disk.
- **os interface** - is the layer that differs depending on which operating system sqlite was compiled for. In this tutorial, I'm not going to
  support multiple platforms.

### Part 2 - World's Simplest SQL Compiler and Virtual Machine

Let's say the "front-end" of sqlite is a SQL compiiler that parses a string and outputs bytecode. This
byte code is passed to the VM, which executes it.

We broke things down into 2 steps to reduce complexity and allow compiling common queries once and
caching the bytecode for improved performance.

Non-SQL statements are called meta-commands. They all start with a dot and we handled them in a separate
function.

In this section we added support for two new keywords: `select` and `insert`.

We also added some enums for response codes to handle errors or to tell us if our operation succeeded.

Here's some logic we added to our sqlite front-end:

- add a step that conversts line of input into internal representation of a statement (`prepare_statement`)
- pass the response of `prepare_statement` to `execute_statement` which will eventually become our VM

We laid out some of the skeleton for the DB so far, in the next part we will implement `insert` and `select`.
